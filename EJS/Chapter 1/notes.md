Chapter 1 - Values, Types, and Operators

6 basic types of Values
- numbers
- strings
- Booleans
- objects
- functions
- undefined Values

Numbers
- 64 bit - binary
- 2e64 different numbers
- math follows bedmas
- modulo % used to calculate the remainder of a division
    - same precedence as multiplication and division
    - ex: 314 % 100 = 14
- special numbers
    - Infinity and -Infinity (+/-)
    - NaN - "not a number"
        - number type that defines a non-number
        - NaN != NaN

Strings
- text
- "this is a string"
- 'this is also a string'
- \ is used to escape certain characters for effect
- the newline 'n' must be escaped
    - \n
    - 'this is on one line\nand this is on the next'
- to express 'the newline code is "\n"' you must escape a lot
    - 'the newline code is \"\\n\"'

Unary Operators
- operates on only a single value
- 'typeof' takes a single value and returns its type as a string
    - typeof 37 ==> number
    - typeof 'jello' ==> string
    - typeof true ==> Boolean
- '-' can be a unary or binary operator
    - binary: 3 - 2 = 1
    - unary: -18 ==> negative 18
