# Tub-O-Script
Default repository for code work.

This repository will be used as a hub for developing my programming skills. I will work towards transcribing my personal notes and migrating my various code exercises here.

###Currently this consists of work from:

Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke http://eloquentjavascript.net/
* With definitions from the [Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)

NodeSchool http://nodeschool.io/
* [Learn You The Node.js](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)
* [Git it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it)
