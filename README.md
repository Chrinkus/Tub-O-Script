# Tub-O-Script
Default repository for code work.

This repository will be used as a hub for developing my programming skills. I will work towards transcribing my personal notes and migrating my various code exercises here.

Currently this consists of work from:

- Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke
http://eloquentjavascript.net/
- NodeSchool - various workshops from many contributors
http://nodeschool.io/
