#Web Audio

This directory will contain my work on learning the Web Audio API with a focus
in creating a serviceable audio management suite for game development. Initial
work & learning has already taken place with random files strewn through
multiple projects. I will attempt to gather all of my work here until I have
a completed engine for export.

This audio suite must:
- load a music track in real time
    - be able to play individual parts from the track if desired
    - be able to pause, resume and end playback on command
- handle sound effects in the main game

This audio suite may:
- reveal knobs for adjusting volume of various tracks (music, FX, ambiance)
- contain an interactive page for creating new sounds
- be muteable in game

This collection was initially placed in the MDN folder but most of my reference
material has come from other sources and thus this learning directory will be
moved to its own sub-directory of the Tubbo repository.
